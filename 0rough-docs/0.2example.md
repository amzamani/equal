## Example Scenarios


**Example:** Imagine a competitor selection system for Amazon (which has 4+ billion products). Given a seller's product, the system must find the best competitor product to benchmark against:
1. Generate relevant search keywords from the product title and category (LLM step - non-deterministic)
2. Search and retrieve candidate competitor products (API step - large result set)
3. Apply filters (price range, rating threshold, review count, category match + LLM based ranking which is non-deterministic)
4. Use an LLM to evaluate relevance and eliminate false positives (LLM step - non-deterministic)
5. Rank and select the single best competitor


> We've basically written the whole selection flow without understanding the EXACT nature of data as that would require exact understanding of 4+ billion products. 

If the selected competitor is a poor match, which step failed? Did the LLM generate irrelevant keywords? Were the filters too strict, eliminating good candidates? Did the ranking algorithm pick the wrong product from qualified options? Without visibility into each decision point, debugging is guesswork.


### Scenario A: Competitor Discovery
Given a seller's product, find the most relevant competitor product to benchmark against.

- Generate search keywords from title, category, and attributes
- Retrieve candidate products from catalog
- Filter by price range, ratings, review velocity, category fit
- Rank remaining candidates by relevance
- Select the single best match

**Why X-Ray matters:** When the selected competitor is irrelevant (a **phone case** matched against a **laptop stand**), you need to know—was it bad keywords? Over-aggressive filters? Poor ranking logic?

### Scenario B: Listing Quality Optimization
Given an existing product listing, generate an optimized version.

- Analyze current listing (title, bullets, description, images)
- Extract high-performing patterns from top competitors
- Identify gaps and opportunities
- Generate improved content variations
- Score and select the best version

**Why X-Ray matters:** If the optimized listing underperforms, you need to trace back—did we learn from the wrong competitors? Miss key attributes? Generate content that didn't match the product?

### Scenario C: Product Categorization
Given a new product, assign it to the correct category in a taxonomy of 10,000+ categories.

- Extract product attributes from title and description
- Match against category requirements and signals
- Handle ambiguous cases (product fits multiple categories)
- Score confidence for top candidates
- Select best-fit category

**Why X-Ray matters:** Miscategorization hurts discoverability. When a "wireless phone charger" ends up in "office supplies," you need to see exactly where the classification logic went wrong.
